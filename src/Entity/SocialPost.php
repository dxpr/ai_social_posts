/**
 * Defines the ContentEntityExample entity.
 *
 * @ingroup socials
 *
 * This is the main definition of the entity type. From it, an EntityType object
 * is derived. The most important properties in this example are listed below.
 *
 * id: The unique identifier of this entity type. It follows the pattern
 * 'moduleName_xyz' to avoid naming conflicts.
 *
 * label: Human readable name of the entity type.
 *
 * handlers: Handler classes are used for different tasks. You can use
 * standard handlers provided by Drupal or build your own, most probably derived
 * from the ones provided by Drupal. In detail:
 *
 * - view_builder: we use the standard controller to view an instance. It is
 *   called when a route lists an '_entity_view' default for the entity type.
 *   You can see this in the entity.socials_social_post.canonical
 *   route in the socials.routing.yml file. The view can be
 *   manipulated by using the standard Drupal tools in the settings.
 *
 * - list_builder: We derive our own list builder class from EntityListBuilder
 *   to control the presentation. If there is a view available for this entity
 *   from the views module, it overrides the list builder if the "collection"
 *   key in the links array in the Entity annotation below is changed to the
 *   path of the View. In this case the entity collection route will give the
 *   view path.
 *
 * - form: We derive our own forms to add functionality like additional fields,
 *   redirects etc. These forms are used when the route specifies an
 *   '_entity_form' or '_entity_create_access' for the entity type. Depending on
 *   the suffix (.add/.default/.delete) of the '_entity_form' default in the
 *   route, the form specified in the annotation is used. The suffix then also
 *   becomes the $operation parameter to the access handler. We use the
 *   '.default' suffix for all operations that are not 'delete'.
 *
 * - access: Our own access controller, where we determine access rights based
 *   on permissions.
 *
 * More properties:
 *
 *  - base_table: Define the name of the table used to store the data. Make sure
 *    it is unique. The schema is automatically determined from the
 *    BaseFieldDefinitions below. The table is automatically created during
 *    installation.
 *
 *  - entity_keys: How to access the fields. Specify fields from
 *    baseFieldDefinitions() which can be used as keys.
 *
 *  - links: Provide links to do standard tasks. The 'edit-form' and
 *    'delete-form' links are added to the list built by the
 *    entityListController. They will show up as action buttons in an additional
 *    column.
 *
 *  - field_ui_base_route: The route name used by Field UI to attach its
 *    management pages. Field UI module will attach its Manage Fields,
 *    Manage Display, and Manage Form Display tabs to this route.
 *
 * There are many more properties to be used in an entity type definition. For
 * a complete overview, please refer to the '\Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityType'
 * class definition.
 *
 * The following construct is the actual definition of the entity type which
 * is read and cached. Don't forget to clear cache after changes.
 *
 * @ContentEntityType(
 *   id = "socials_social_post",
 *   label = @Translation("Social Post"),
 *   handlers = {
 *     "view_builder" = "Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityViewBuilder",
 *     "list_builder" = "Drupal\socials\Entity\Controller\SocialPostListBuilder",
 *     "form" = {
 *       "default" = "Drupal\socials\Form\SocialPostForm",
 *       "delete" = "Drupal\socials\Form\SocialPostDeleteForm",
 *     },
 *     "access" = "Drupal\socials\SocialPostAccessControlHandler",
 *   },
 *   base_table = "social_post",
 *   admin_permission = "administer social post entity",
 *   entity_keys = {
 *     "id" = "id",
 *     "uuid" = "uuid",
 *   },
 *   links = {
 *     "canonical" = "/social_post/{socials_social_post}",
 *     "edit-form" = "/social_post/{socials_social_post}/edit",
 *     "delete-form" = "/social_post/{socials_social_post}/delete",
 *     "collection" = "/admin/content/social-posts"
 *   },
 * )
 *
 * The 'links' above are defined by their path. For core to find the
 * corresponding route, the route name must follow the correct pattern:
 *
 * entity.<entity_type>.<link_name>
 *
 * Example: 'entity.socials_social_post.canonical'.
 *
 * See the routing file at socials.routing.yml for the
 * corresponding implementation.
 *
 * The SocialPost class defines methods and fields for the social_post entity.
 *
 * Being derived from the ContentEntityBase class, we can override the methods
 * we want. In our case we want to provide access to the standard fields about
 * creation and changed time stamps.
 *
 * Our interface (see SocialPostInterface) also exposes the EntityOwnerInterface.
 * This allows us to provide methods for setting and providing ownership
 * information.
 *
 * The most important part is the definitions of the field properties for this
 * entity type. These are of the same type as fields added through the GUI, but
 * they can by changed in code. In the definition we can define if the user with
 * the rights privileges can influence the presentation (view, edit) of each
 * field.
 *
 * The class also uses the EntityChangedTrait trait which allows it to record
 * timestamps of save operations.
